### **General idea** ###
Well I've decided to make an RP game mode as I think that RP is, in many peoples opinion what Garry's Mod was actually intended for, and don't get me wrong RP is fun; just sometimes gets quite boring without many players to RP. So I came up with the idea to RP while under constant attack from spawning NPC's, I think that this will be more fun and also makes sure people are doing there job ;).
